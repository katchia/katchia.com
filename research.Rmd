## applied research and product
I’ve applied my background in cognitive science and machine learning to build AI-powered products that are grounded in research, scalable in production, and human-centered by design.

At Cangrade, a B2B SaaS company delivering predictive hiring solutions, I’ve led product-focused research efforts and brought multiple tools to market:

- **AI Copilot**: A generative AI assistant that automates hiring workflows. I led the product development and launch, translating NLP and LLM advances into a seamless user experience.

- **[Resume Ranker](https://ppubs.uspto.gov/api/patents/html/12287833?source=USPAT&requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiIzZGMxZGIxNS1hOTc4LTRmYWItYTJiZS1hNDhiMWE4NDY0ZjMiLCJ2ZXIiOiJmMWE5ZTI0My01MjA3LTQ0YWItYWEwNi03N2Y0YzY4MjgyOTkiLCJleHAiOjB9)**: An AI-based scoring tool that evaluates resumes against hiring criteria. I owned this product from concept through prototyping, engineering handoff, and go-to-market planning.

- **Position-Specific Assessments** (Patent Pending): A tool that uses LLMs to generate custom skill assessments directly from job descriptions. I led product strategy and development, and filed the corresponding patent.

Beyond product development, I’ve conducted user and market research, competitive analyses, and authored industry-facing white papers that were featured in Fast Company, HR.com, Yahoo!, and others. These efforts not only guided product direction but also helped position the company as a leader in Responsible AI.

At **IBM Research**, I worked with [Dr. Rachel Ostrand](https://t.co/9UGZ2yoDIn?amp=1) to investigate how spontaneous speech could serve as a biomarker of cognitive decline. I analyzed linguistic data from older adults, built part-of-speech tagging tools in Python, and supported early ideation for a clinician-facing product for dementia screening.

## academic research 

I began my research journey as an undergraduate at Florida State University, where I joined three labs to explore diverse areas of cognitive science:

- [Dr. Walter Boot](https://www.walterboot.net/) – attention and visual search

- Dr. Colleen Kelley – memory and directed forgetting

- [Dr. Michael Kaschak](https://psychology.fsu.edu/person/michael-kaschak) – language processing and structural priming

After graduating, I worked as a lab coordinator for [Dr. Arielle Borovsky](https://sites.google.com/site/arielleborovsky?_ga=2.86706778.316547478.1751411826-1891238087.1751411826), where I led day-to-day operations for a longitudinal study on language development in infants. This role strengthened my skills in participant management, experimental design, and team mentorship.

I went on to earn my Ph.D. in Cognitive Science at Florida State under the mentorship of [Dr. Michael Kaschak](https://psychology.fsu.edu/person/michael-kaschak). My research focused on linguistic alignment and language production, resulting in four peer-reviewed publications (three as first author). I led experimental design, analysis, and manuscript development, while mentoring undergraduates and teaching data science with R.

These academic experiences gave me a strong foundation in empirical thinking, structured experimentation, and clear communication — all of which inform my work as a product-minded research scientist today.
