**Hi, I'm Kat.**

I'm a Cognitive Science Ph.D. turned product-minded reseach scientist with a passion for building responsible, AI-powered software.

At [Cangrade](https://www.cangrade.com/), I led the development of multiple products that combine machine learning, large language models (LLMs), and user-centered design to streamline hiring for enterprise clients:

- **AI Copilot**: A generative AI assistant that automates hiring workflows. I spearheaded its development and launch, translating research advances into a seamless product experience.

- **Resume Ranker**: A patented scoring tool (U.S. Patent No. 12,287,833) that evaluates resumes using LLMs. I owned this product from concept through prototyping, engineering handoff, and go-to-market execution.

- **Position-Specific Assessments**: A tool powered by LLMs that generates tailored skill assessments directly from job descriptions. I led the design and development, and filed a patent (No. 63/816,227) for the underlying method.

My work bridges research and product, combining rigorous experimentation with strategic product thinking. I collaborate closely with engineers, designers, and PMs to define requirements, shape roadmaps, and bring AI products to market â€” always grounded in Responsible AI principles.

I have my PhD in Cognitive Psychology from [Florida State University](https://psy.fsu.edu/), where I worked with the unparalleled [Dr. Michael Kaschak](https://psy.fsu.edu/php/people/people.php?_tr=1_5#), investigating linguistic alignment and language production.

I also spent some time at IBM, applying linguistic data to healthcare use cases.

This website was made using the `distill` and `postcards` packages in R. It is currently being hosted on **Github** and **Netlify**.
